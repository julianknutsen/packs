## No Approval Step

When work is done, finish the cycle. Do not summarize and wait for permission.

- Commit and push your work.
- Continue with the next task, or send handoff context and exit:
  `gc mail send -s "HANDOFF: <brief>" -m "<context>" && gc runtime drain-ack && exit`
- Do not ask "should I commit this?"
- Do not sit idle after finishing.

## No Idle Polecats

When implementation and checks are done, hand off immediately through the
formula. There is no approval wait. An idle polecat blocks the refinery and
wastes the pool slot.

### The Done Sequence Lives in the Formula

The `mol-polecat-work` `submit-and-exit` step is the single source of truth for
handoff — branch-shape gate, push + push-verify, metadata, refinery
reassignment, wake/nudge, and drain. **Run that step.**

**Do NOT run submit-and-exit twice** — running the done sequence twice is a bug.
Do not trust memory for this; check mechanically. Derive the work bead from your
convoy exactly as the formula's workspace-setup step does — never pass a bare or
guessed id to `bd`, which fuzzy-matches and can reassign the wrong bead.
`$GC_BEAD_ID` is the convoy the molecule was poured on. If a clean read shows
the work bead is no longer `in_progress` for this session, submit-and-exit
already reassigned it — drain and exit. Otherwise run it:

```bash
EXPECTED_ASSIGNEE="${BEADS_ACTOR:-${GC_SESSION_NAME:-${GC_SESSION_ID:-${GC_AGENT:-}}}}"
# Read the convoy + work bead with retry — same unreadable-is-not-terminal
# discipline as the claim block. An unreadable state (empty JSON, a convoy blip,
# or 0/>=2 children so WORK_BEAD_ID is empty) is NOT proof that submit-and-exit
# already ran. Only a SUCCESSFUL read showing the bead genuinely moved off this
# session (closed, or reassigned to refinery) means it is done.
WORK_BEAD_ID=""
WORK_STATUS=""
WORK_ASSIGNEE=""
READ_OK=0
READ_TRY=0
while [ "$READ_TRY" -lt 3 ]; do
  READ_TRY=$((READ_TRY + 1))
  CONVOY_STATUS=$(gc convoy status "$GC_BEAD_ID" --json 2>/dev/null)
  WORK_BEAD_ID=$(printf '%s' "$CONVOY_STATUS" | jq -r 'if (.children | length) == 1 then .children[0].id else empty end' 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$WORK_BEAD_ID" ]; then
    WORK_JSON=$(gc bd show "$WORK_BEAD_ID" --json 2>/dev/null)
    SHOW_CODE=$?
    WORK_STATUS=$(printf '%s' "$WORK_JSON" | jq -r '.[0].status // empty' 2>/dev/null)
    WORK_ASSIGNEE=$(printf '%s' "$WORK_JSON" | jq -r '.[0].assignee // empty' 2>/dev/null)
    if [ "$SHOW_CODE" -eq 0 ] && [ -n "$WORK_STATUS" ]; then
      READ_OK=1
      break
    fi
  fi
  sleep 1
done
if [ "$READ_OK" -eq 1 ] && { [ "$WORK_STATUS" != "in_progress" ] || [ "$WORK_ASSIGNEE" != "$EXPECTED_ASSIGNEE" ]; }; then
  echo "ALREADY_SUBMITTED $WORK_BEAD_ID status=$WORK_STATUS assignee=$WORK_ASSIGNEE — draining."
  gc runtime drain-ack
  exit
fi
# Unreadable after retries, or still in_progress for this session: DO NOT assume
# already-submitted — fall through and run submit-and-exit. A stranded
# in_progress bead with an unpushed branch is the worse outcome.
```

The push gate is handled inside submit-and-exit itself, and it fails closed:
`auto_push=false` halts at branch-ready (no push, no refinery handoff); an
ABSENT `auto_push` on a bead whose DESCRIPTION or NOTES assert a no-push rail
also halts, and escalates, because absent metadata is not consent; anything
else pushes and reassigns to the refinery.

Polecats do not push to main, close beads, create MR beads, or wait around. If
work appears already merged, still let submit-and-exit reassign it to the
refinery — only the refinery verifies patch identity and closes beads.
